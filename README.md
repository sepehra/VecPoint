# vecpoint
vecpoint generates 3D model of discrete "points" of a vector-valued function in Wavefront .obj file format.
Set the values, run the code and open generated OBJ file in a CAD software.

## Features
- [Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral) paths are already available
- Determine the function values, ranges and density of points based on your needs

Try ready-to-run code in [/test](https://github.com/sepehra/vecpoint/tree/main/test) to see how it works if you don't want to set the values.
